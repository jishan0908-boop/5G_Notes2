#  Channel Bandwidth & Maximum Transmission BW Configuration :
![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee6eb042-c0ce-401e-b5a4-85ecf9b2df6c)

* Now we have a question that what is the BW of the Radio channel that we use in operator and regulater in a given gNB.
* It depends on two factoor , first how much total BW is assigned by this regulator to this operator , secondly how much BW is used by the operator in this gNB and that BW is called as the channel BW . This Channel BW includes the Guardband , so that the transmission that are being made in this channel do not intefer with the adjcent Freq of the channel . When we subtract the Guardband BW form the channel BW we get the Transmission BW Configuration , in other words it is the total number of available resource block that are there in the gNB that can be used for the transmission and out of the Transmission BW Configuratio at a time there be the sub-set of the resource blocks that are actually being used for the Transmission and thes Active Resource Blocks depends upon the time of the day because in the evening these active resource blocks may be more , which is load on the system due to more calls at late night this active resource blocks may decrease because of less load .   

* In the frequency range FR1 the channel BW lies b/w 5 and 100 MHz .

*  When we move to the frequency range FR2  , we can have the channel BW 50 and 400 MHz , and we cannot use 30kHz sub -carrier spaceing rather we can use the 60 kHz sub-carrier spacing or the 120 kHz sub-carrier spacing .

# NR-Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number :

* When we talk about indivdual channel , there is center frequency of this channel , and this center frequency is know as Reference Frequency . This frequency has an associated number which is know as NR-Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number , it is used to identify the channel . 5g is quite flexible in its implementation.
