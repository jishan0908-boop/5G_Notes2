# 5G_Notes2
# CHAPTER 1:
## Standardization of 5G :
* ITU-R ( International Telecommunication Union - Radiocommunication ) it is responsible for the developement of 5G reqirements.
* They are responsilbe for the previous Radiocommunication technology like 3G , 4G and now for 5G.
* These requirenemts are then taken by 3GPP , it is organisezation which is consortium of the major Telcom Venors and Operators.
* When technical specification are finalised then vendor makes the equipments accordingly .

## ITU-R minimal technical requirements for IMT2020:
* Like peak data rate should 20Gbps , it means like ,  there is cell an dthere is user in the cell , that a cell is using its all resources to provide data to the user cell.
* Actualy-User-experienced Data rate which is btw ( 100-1000 ) Mbps , this mean that if we are in a large cell then in that case the minimum data rate that the user must be able to experience is 100 Mbps , if we are in a building and have a cell then user will experience 1000Mbps.
* Area Traffic Capacity , in case of 5G in a area of 1m2 where it experince 10Mps/m2.
* Network Energy Efficency , this is speically use in IOT where mutliple sensors are connected and transmitted minmum data , and we want these senors to last longer in life .
* Connection Density , in case of 5G , these are also essential for the IOT like multiple sensors are connected with 1 milloions of users .
* Latency , it defines as a time taken by the device to send data to another device is called latency , which should not be greater than 1ms.
* Mobility , 5G is desgine to support high speed moving device , where speed can be 500m/h.
* Spectrum efficency , in 5G it must be 3time higher it mesare in bits/sec.Hz.

## Roadmap of 5G :
* 3GPP plays a major role in the standarziation of 5G network :
* The standardization is divided in two phase :
* 5G phase_1
* 5G phase_2

# Chapter 2:

# 5G ARCHITECTURE :
## 5G ARCHITECTURE HAS THREE MAIN COMPNENTRS:
* UE ( USER EQUIPMENT ) like , mobiles .
* NG-RAN ( NEXT GENRATION - RADIO ACCES NETWORK ) it is base upon the 5G nr ( new radio ) technology , and the main component of the NG-RAN is the gNB( next genration NodeB ) , gNB is the tower from which this UE connects , 
*
